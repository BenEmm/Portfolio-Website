Whilst that is what I'd originally intended for the website, sort of an online portfolio, I got bored of it. So, here's a blog! The internet could use another one of those, right?</p> <p>For the longest time I've had a pretty archaic workflow when it comes to maintaining this website. The workflow went like this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Make changes in VS Code</p> </li> <li> <p>Commit those changes to GitHub</p> </li> <li> <p>Grab the local files for the website and upload them to my hosting platform</p> </li> <li> <p>Deploy the new website</p> </li> </ol> <p>This was all very... Manual. There was a lot of wasted time and it was just... Annoying. So, I've automated it!</p> <p>I discovered that my hosting provider intergrates pretty seamlessly with GitHub, and I can link my hosting to a GitHub repo. This way, everytime I commit changes to the main branch of the repo it'll automatically be shown on the website! So now, my workflow looks like this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Make changes in VS Code</p> </li> <li> <p>Commit the changes to Github - the changes are now live.</p> </li> </ol> <p>I've halved the amount of steps needed to deploy changes success!</p>"},{"location":"archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""}]}
