We've all probably used them at some point. Whether it's to block adverts or to improve the functionality of websites, browser extensions have proven to be nifty little gadgets for well over a decade. It was this nifty-ness that prompted me to become interested in them. They we're easy to distribute - people just clicked \"install\" in an app store, they were lightweight, yet had the power to transform the internet - count me in!</p> <p>So, long story short I developed an extremely niche browser extension which now has over 100 users worldwide, it's open source, and has been growing steadily since it's release.</p> <p></p> <p>The processes has been extremely rewarding on multiple fronts.  I first came up with the idea for Focus Search whilst at university. When researching for an essay, or trying to solve a bug in my programming work, I'd do what everyone does - go to a search engine or website and search for my issue. The problem was I always found I'd have to manually click inside the search box on any given website to begin my search. It seemed obvious that if I were going to a library, directory, or eCommerce website I already have an idea of what I'm looking for in my head, I'm not going to click around to browse, so why not have the search bar automatically \"in focus\" ready for me to type? Why force me to tediously move my hands from my keyboard, click the search box, then go back to typing each time?</p> <p>I'm aware that this seems like a very minor inconvenience - if we can even call it that, but for people doing 50-100 of these searches per day, it because extremely annoying! (I did warn you this addon was niche).</p> <p>Anyway - I took this idea to my university supervisor planning to create it for my \"final year project\". However, I was told in no uncertain terms that it was pretty useless, served no real world purpose and wasn't really complex enough to be considered for the project. Annoyed, I shelved the idea whilst I continued my studies. At this time, i'd conducted market research to see if anything like my idea existed, because why go to all the trouble building it if I could just click \"install\" and have this problem solved for me? Well, it didn't exist. I checked the Chrome Addon Store, the Mozilla addon store and even looked around forums - nobody was offering anything.</p> <p>Cut to 4 months later after I'd finished university, I revisited this idea as I was still annoyed by the way the web worked. To my surprise, not one but three addons had now popped up solving the issue I'd originally identified. Even more surprising, all together they had thousands of users! This meant not only had other people created a solution to the problem I'd originally identified, but thousands of people were waiting in the wings actively looking for a solution to this problem as well!</p>"},{"location":"2024/04/27/my-first-blog-post/","title":"Hello, World!","text":"<p>If everything has clicked into place (and I haven't broken anything) you're reading my very first blog post!</p> <p>My website started off as a static portfolio, which was great at first. It did exactly what I needed- it got me a first in my web development module at university as well as showcasing my work to future employers, without too many bells or whistles. But in all honestly, it was a bit... too static. So I've decided to add some life to it with a blog... because the internet needed more of those!</p> <p>Before I could make this blog, I needed a way to actually update the website fast, as making a blog post should be quick and painless. My previous workflow was as follows:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Code any updates in VS Code</p> </li> <li> <p>Commit those updates to GitHub</p> </li> <li> <p>Upload the local files manually to my hosting provider.</p> <ul> <li>Inevitably fumble with a 2FA code somewhere along the line.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Hit the deploy button and beam the updates to the interwebs.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This was... Tedious. It didn't lend itself well to creating content. Well, not anymore! I've streamlined the whole thing thanks to some clever work behind the scenes. I discovered that my hosting provider plays well with GitHub. This has allowed me to directly link my hosting with my websites GitHub repo, so every time I push updates to the main branch, boom - the changes are live. Thanks to this, my workflow now looks like this: </p> <ol> <li> <p>Make the changes in VS Code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Commit the changes to GitHub - the changes are now live.</p> </li> </ol> <p>And just like that, I've halved my workload whilst also adding a blog!</p> <p>The last piece of the puzzle was figuring out where to put this blog, and that's where subdomains came to the rescue! I still wanted future employers and curious people to have a streamlined and neat way of learning about me, so I've kept the static site as it always was, and then span up 'blog.ben-mcleod.com' and now here we are, the main site isn't cluttered with blog posts and the only people that have the misfortune of seeing my ramblings are the poor souls that discover this page!</p>"},{"location":"archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"category/general/","title":"General","text":""}]}
