# Creating A Browser Extension - Focus Search
Browser Extensions. We've all probably used them at some point. Whether it's to block adverts or to improve the functionality of websites, browser extensions have proven to be nifty little gadgets for well over a decade.
It was this nifty-ness that prompted me to become interested in them. They we're easy to distribute - people just clicked "install" in an app store, they were lightweight, yet had the power to transform the internet - count me in!

So, long story short I developed an extremely niche browser extension which now has over 100 users worldwide, it's open source, and has been growing steadily since it's release.
