# Hello, World!

If all has gone well, this will be my first blog post!

I decided that my website was a little too... static. Whilst that *is* what I'd originally intended for the website, sort of an online portfolio, I got bored of it. So, here's a blog! <br>The internet could use another one of those, right?

For the longest time I've had a pretty archaic workflow when it comes to maintaining this website. The workflow went like this:

1. Make changes in VS Code

2. Commit those changes to GitHub

3. Grab the local files for the website and upload them to my hosting platform

4. Deploy the new website

This was all very... Manual. There was a lot of wasted time and it was just... Annoying. So, I've automated it!

I discovered that my hosting provider intergrates pretty seamlessly with GitHub, and I can link my hosting to a GitHub repo. This way, everytime I commit changes to the main branch of the repo it'll automatically be shown on the website! So now, my workflow looks like this:

1. Make changes in VS Code

2. Commit the changes to Github - the changes are now live.

I've halved the amount of steps needed to deploy changes *success!*
