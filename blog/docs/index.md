# Welcome to My Blog

**If you're looking for my portfolio website visit: [ben-mcleod.com](https://www.ben-mcleod.com).**

There isn't much here yet in all honesty - and that's probably a good thing - it's not like the internet needs *another* blog.
My plan is to keep this a useful-ish place, full of write ups and guides for things I get up to in my spare time, whether that be Raspberry Pi projects, Penetration Testing labs, cool tech I've messed around with... You get the picture.
