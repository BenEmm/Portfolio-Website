# My Porfolio

Hello, World!

In this file, you can find a brief description of my portfolio website in markdown format.

This project is a portfolio website designed for my CTEC3905 assignment. It was important to me to challenge myself throughout this assignment, engaging with both the lab materials and further learning through the use of [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn), [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) & [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/). Throughout this project, I have also utilised icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and followed their [guides on how to make icons with semantic meaning accessible](https://fontawesome.com/v5/docs/web/other-topics/accessibility). As well as the above, I have also utilised a guide from [Kevin Powell](https://youtu.be/wodWDIdV9BY) for my dark mode implementation, however I have expanded upon this by using CSS custom variables in my implementation, custom icons and animating the icons.

For this assignment, I set myself the challenge of designing something that would be suitable to get a high mark as well as something I'd be happy using in the real world once my studies are complete. I designed the website using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, and tried to teach myself modern techniques such as CSS resets, CSS pseudo classes, animation and organising HTML content with appropriate semantic tags so that this project could be used as a reference or template in my future endeavours.

The website was designed with an audience of recruiters and potential employers in mind and as such features descriptions about myself and content they would likely be interested in, such as my qualifications and projects I've worked on. Knowing that my audience would be engaging with the website on a variety of devices I have adapted the website for different screen sizes using CSS Media Queries, utilising a mobile first design and scaling up from there.

I have tried to incorporate as many interesting features as I could into this website both to make the website interesting and to aid in my learning. Things that may seem straight forward, such as the copyright text at the bottom of the page, have actually had substantial thought put into them. In this case, the copyright text on my website is a JavaScript function, which updates the text with the current year automatically. As well as the copyright text, the subheading in the websites intro section also utilises a JavaScript function to provide a typing effect, rather than simply a static heading. As well as this, JavaScript has been utilised to give the website a dark mode should the user choose to enable it, as well as making use of the Open Weather API to provide up-to-date weather information of my location.

## Things to lookout for:

- Dark mode toggle which allows you to view in light or dark mode.
- Your darkmode choice will be saved! This has been achieved through the use of local storage, so no cookies!
- Fancy animations on the dark mode toggle, intro subheading and the location pin on the Google map.
- The website is fully responsive and utilises a mobile first design, check it out on all your devices!
